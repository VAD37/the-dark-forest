# economic-value

Take a look at Axie and crypto kitties game.

- Traits make NFTs rare and unique. This is collection value.
- Only NFTs owner can create new NFTs (by breeding). This is [[self-contained-economy]] design that make the value NFTs not faded away.
- Rarer NFTs give owner better chance to gain more value/assets.

## Implementation

- This game NFT have built in mechanics to generate token by itself. Everyone can mint token if they have enough time, veteran player will have much more income. Check [[growth-system]].
- The breed mechanism or give new player access to the game will be same as Axie. Check [[upgrade-system]]. Player can choose to build new ark for new player or use their resource to defense themselves.
- The [[war-system]] will make the game total asset deflate over time. So any stronger player can make the price of token increase simply by creating war.
