# attachment-value

Beside the economic power of NFTs token hold in [[ecosystem]].
By giving some intrinsic value to NFTs, player will not trade/sell their unique token for a rational income decision. We expect player to hold the NFTs as a part of their own identity, value.

## Proposed Method

- Allow customizing the value of NFTs. Some simple characteristics like image, name, description, etc. If player want to have a website for their own token (Ex: arweave web), we let them and show it on client. For this prototype project, a version of multiple images along with multiple descriptions are provided through IPFS seem reasonable choice. [[customNFT-system]]
- A history of action/achievement of NFTs is also stored on the token (same as kudo token). Just so if token is transfer to new owner, the glory will be given to new owner too. A special value/trait attached to kudo that give boost to economic value of token can be given. So player have the incentive to gain these. [[kudo-system]]
