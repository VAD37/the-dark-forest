# core value

The value that make **The Dark Forest** unique and successful. This cannot be changed.

- [[trust]]: devalue what make Bitcoin great to give room for appreciation of decentralization.
- [[self-contained-economy]]: the core of [[Play To Earn]] game.
- [[community-ownership]]: lesson learned from CryptoKitties.
- The power of [[autonomy]] is extremely important to make this game work. This is the reason why this game logic must be written in 100% smart-contract. So player can make concession what part of self that can be lost to retain their stake ingame instead losing everything after invasion.
