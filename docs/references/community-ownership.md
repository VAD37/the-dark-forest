# community-ownership

The ownership here means anything created in economy is belong to the community. Not the developer but the player.

Only the community or players can create new NFT which can be trade or sold for new player. So that's way the value of ecosystem depend on what people inside the community do and what other people outside value its.

On simple term, whatever you make in the game, stay in the game, belong to your. You can sell it to other people for money. Because they need it to join the game. As long as there are people play the game, the game have value. The dev only monetize service to the community.
