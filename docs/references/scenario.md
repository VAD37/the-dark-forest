# scenario

Player decision can be quite unpredicted. With this kind of meme game, we expect some irrational player action will make the entire game [[ecosystem]] to throw in chaos.

## Dark nature

Assuming everyone on blockchain is looking out for their best interest, which is to make the most **income** to upgrade their civ.

- Because any form of aggression will meet the risk of aggression, this can leads to a chain attacking, where everyone just patiently wait for opportunity to attack any vulnerable attacker or even better rob them after they return with loots. And when should the chain end?
- The defender can just send army to the attacker during troops movement [[timelock]]. Hope that if they rob me then I can rob them at the same time too. If they destroy my civ, I will destroy their too. But who will withdraw the army first?

## Coop nature

- Players can form coalition to help each other. One can focus on economy, one focus on production building army, one focus on war. To send reinforcement if detect a threat.
- Or this Union could be used a way to snowball their income and make them stronger than everyone else. Then they start to attack the other smaller civ. Root out any potential threat.

## Where Smart Contract come in

Because the game is 100% smart contract, people can make an overseer contract like Gnosis multiSafe to control multiple civ. Or even better, force weaker player to give up their right to NFTs, and use a another layer of forced-contract as owner of the NFTs.
=> A much more powerful civ can force other civ to become vassal for protection. They can write a contract split their tax income while some abilities can be retained.
=> Or an alliance that force other player to send reinforcement as help.

This give the players the freedom to control the ownership. The possibility are endless.
