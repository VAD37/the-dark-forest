# self-contained-economy

This concept was pointed out by the developer of Axie Infinity game.
I think this is the [[core value]] success of any [[Play To Earn]] game.

Player must do some form of action or work to create value. And these value must belong solely to the player and can only be used in this same economy. Either by consuming themselves or give to another player that want to join this economy.
