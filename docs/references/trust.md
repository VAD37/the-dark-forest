# trust

By taking away the security of trust, it make every player in looming danger of losing everything.
You can see what other people are doing. How much army do they have?
Same for other can see your history of actions. How can we trust someone have destroyed another person NFT or have long history of bully invasion?

If you have bigger army everyone else, you can be a victim of invasion. How can anyone believe this rich guys to be noble, peaceful while building up huge reserve?

So basically, this game depend on the inaction of other players as a way to build up friction. While any form of action will show the intention of other players, it might not be a good way to gain trust.

The only form of trust that other can believe is through cripple the function of their own NFT. By disable the ability to attack or gain income, it is a waste of resources for aggression.
