# The Dark Forest (Draft)

A game designed for ETHGlobal #Hackathon BuildQuest 2022. [Source](https://github.com/VAD37/the-dark-forest)

This is a WIP.

## Project goals

- Redefine [[NFT]] common-knowledge to stay true with [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). Instead of rarity of NFT URI based-image rely on marketing value only, it should have both [[economic-value]] and [[attachment-value]] for [[P2E]] game to work.
- Design and develop a [[P2E]] game with [[self-contained-economy]] and [[community-ownership]] in mind. Because these traits are what make blockchain game worth for a long time.
