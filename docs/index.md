# A Dark Nature game

A game designed for ETHGlobal #Hackathon BuildQuest 2022. [Source](https://github.com/VAD37/the-dark-forest)

This is a WIP.

## Project goals

- Redefine [[NFT]] common-knowledge to stay true with [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). Instead of rarity of NFT URI based-image rely on marketing value only, it should have both [[economic-value]] and [[attachment-value]] for [[P2E]] game to work.
- Design and develop a [[P2E]] game with [[self-contained-economy]] and [[community-ownership]] in mind. Because these traits are what make blockchain game worth for a long time.

## Game Concept

This is a P2E building management game resolve around trust. A game where peaceful player can develop their economy to generate new asset exponentially or warmonger player choose invade to destroy other. Every player always under the threat of getting their NFT **burn forever** if failed to defense themselves.

## Gameplay concept

To increase economic power, player required to get resources unique to other people NFTs. The starting resources is random generated. This force player to cooperate with other player to generate new asset.

Since blockchain have full transparency, it is easy to track other people progress and even army. And attacking is almost instantly, this make no one is safe. It was designed this way to make the game more interesting. As anyone invade another player, they can extort other player for their resources or lost their NFTs forever.

Or if every player decide that no one should invade and any form of aggression is not allowed, the game can practically end when everyone can reach the peak of economic power and minting infinite token until it reach 2^256.
Or a few group of people can hold rare resources monopoly simply by destroying competition.

The game was designed to be written in 100% smart contract. So player can make pact, alliance, or even vassalize other player.

The goal of players either to [[endgame]] by overflowing master contract to call selfdestruct function or to conquer the world.
