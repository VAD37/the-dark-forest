# The Dark Forest (Draft)

A game designed for ETHGlobal #Hackathon BuildQuest 2022. [Source](https://github.com/VAD37/the-dark-forest)

This is a WIP.

Project goals:

- Redefine [[NFT]] concept to stay true with [EIP-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721). Instead of rarity of NFT URI based-image rely on marketing value only, it should have both practical and [[attachment-value]] for [[P2E]] game to work.

### Old Draft

The Dark Forest is an experimental 100% smart-contract code based on Rinkeby network.
It is designed to explore the current limitation of full blockchain game and build the framework for the next genre of [[P2E]] game.
Due to the time frame of #Hackathon, the game scope will just be a simple prototype while this docs clarify the vision of a true blockchain on Ethereum would look like.

## What is this game about?

The dark forest is a [[meme]] civilization building, strategy game. With [[self-contained-economy]] and [[community-ownership]] in mind as [[core-value]], along with the nature of blockchain [[transparency]] as a whole, this create some unique game mechanics.

The player will be given a unique [[NFT]] space to develop their civilization.
Each new civ can choose their [[specialty]] path to focus on.

Player can focus on [[economy]] which give player an exponential growth effect for their [[production]] later.
Or it can be a focus on [[war]], which allow player to invade other to loot [[locked resources]] and [[token]].

Every victory invader have the [[choice]] to annihilate the defender. By that means the NFT contract can be completely burned/self-destruct by other forever.
The consequence for losing is designed to be this devastating is the [[core-value]] that make this game **unique**. By removing the capability of [[trust]].

This allow the possibility of some **dark** [[scenario]] that can happen. Hence the name of the game (inspired by the actual novel).
