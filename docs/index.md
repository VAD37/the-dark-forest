# The Dark Forest

A game designed for ETHGlobal #Hackathon BuildQuest 2022.

The Dark Forest is an experimental 100% smart-contract code based on Rinkeby network.
It is designed to explore the current limitation of full blockchain game and build the framework for the next genre of [[Play To Earn]] game.
Due to the limitation of #Hackathon, the game scope will just be a simple prototype while this docs clarify the vision of a true blockchain of Ethereum would look like.

## What is this game about?

The dark forest is a civilization building, strategy game. With [[self-contained-economy]] and [[community-ownership]] in mind as [[core value]], along with the nature of blockchain [[transparency]] as a whole, this create some unique game mechanics.

The player will be given a unique [[NFT]] space to develop their civilization.
Each civ can make #choice for their [[specialty]] path to focus on.

It can be a focus on [[economy]] which give player an exponential growth effect for their [[production]] later.
Or it can be a focus on [[war]], which allow player to invade other to stole all their [[locked resources]] and [[token]].

Every victory invader have the #choice to annihilate the defender. By that means NFT civ can be completely burned by other forever.
The penalty for losing is designed to be this extreme is the [[core value]] that make blockchain game **unique** from previous game generation.

This allow the possibility of some **dark** [[scenario]] that can happen. Hence the name of the game (inspired by the actual novel).
